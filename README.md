# Crop Prediction System with Raspberry Pi Pico

## Overview
This project utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to implement a smart agriculture system. It integrates sensor data collection, machine learning, and real-time display to predict suitable crops based on soil conditions.

## Summary
The system employs DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, along with a pH sensor, to gather essential soil data. A machine learning model deployed on the Raspberry Pi Pico analyzes this data to provide instant crop predictions. The results are displayed on an LCD screen for user convenience.

## Methodology
1. **Integration of Machine Learning Model**: A trained machine learning model is integrated into the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.
2. **Sensor Connection**: DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, along with a pH sensor, are connected to the Pico for measuring soil parameters.
3. **Data Transmission**: Collected data is transmitted to the machine learning model for crop prediction.
4. **Display**: Real-time information, including recommended crops and corresponding parameters, is displayed on an LCD screen.
